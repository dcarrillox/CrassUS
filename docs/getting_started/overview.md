# Overview


CrassUS is a pipeline for identifying and classifying bacteriophages from the
_Crassvirales_ order. Taking as input a metagenome/metavirome, CrassUS is able to
identify which contigs are _Crassvirales_ and to classify them into the different
families, subfamilies, genera and species in the order.
